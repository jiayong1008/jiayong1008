## HarvardX
HarvardX is an online learning initiative by *Harvard University* through [edX](https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx) online platform. These courses are also taught physically in Harvard itself. I have learnt a fair lot from these courses, to name a few, fundamentals of programming with C and Python, web programming with Python's Flask, Django, SQLite, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence. View my [Harvard repository](https://github.com/jiayong1008/harvardx) where I include some of my projects.  

## APU Projects
The [APU Project repository](https://github.com/jiayong1008/apu) contains projects or assignments which I have completed during my Diploma study in Asia Pacific University (APU), Malaysia. Do check it out. 😄

## Personal Projects
This very repository is where I store all my personal projects that are neither Harvard nor APU's assignment. Each project are unique from each other and are developed when I have the need to automate something or find myself interested in a certain project. All my projects are listed as below, though, I plan to add more to this list as the time goes by:

1. **Sudoku**  
**Description:** Dump a sudoku question into this program, it will solve it for you, no matter how hard it is, provided the sudoku is indeed solvable. Try dumping any 'extreme' sudoku you find online to this program, if my program failed to solve, I owe you an ice cream 🍦.  
**Language:** Python

2. **Stock**  
**Description:** Besides coding, I have quite some interest in stocks and real estates. Hence, I developed this program to calculate stock fees for me, taking into account the current stamp duty, SST, clearance, and broker fee. Why do I need to calculate when the broker website will calculate it for me if I do purchase? Because even if I do buy, they take at least a day to include that in your account, unfortunately, I don't have patience when it comes to managing finance 😆.  
**Language:** Python

3. **Property**  
**Description:** With my obsession in properties / real estate, I often find myself calculating the profitability of Malaysian real estates. Do I even have the money to purchase it? Certainly not, considering I can't even afford a toy house (just joking, of course), but I do have deep interest in it. With that said, I developed this program to do all the maths for me.  
**Language:** Python

4. **Microsoft Teams Bot**  
**Description:** Oh yes, sometimes I do like to annoy my classmates abit, so I developed this Microsoft Teams Bot to spam my friends if I need to. Note that I only do this for entartainment purposes, I have no intention to ruin any class or overdoing it, I do make sure that the time is appropriate to do so before doing it. A bit of humour is good for our mental health, no? 👀  
**Language:** Python

I am open to any project feedback or recommendations, if you have one, do let me know. 😄
