## HarvardX
HarvardX is an online learning initiative by *Harvard University* through [edX](https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx) online platform. These courses are also taught physically in Harvard itself. I have learnt a fair lot from these courses, to name a few, fundamentals of programming with C and Python, web programming with Python's Flask, Django, SQLite, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence. View my [Harvard repository](https://github.com/jiayong1008/harvardx) where I include some of my projects.  

## Personal Projects
This very repository is where I store all my personal projects that are neither Harvard nor APU's assignment. Each project are unique from each other and are developed when I have the need to automate something or find myself interested in a certain project. All my projects are listed as below, though, I plan to add more to this list as the time goes by:
