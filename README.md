## HarvardX
HarvardX is an online learning initiative by *Harvard University* through [edX](https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx) online platform. These courses are also taught physically in Harvard itself. View my [Harvard repository](https://github.com/jiayong1008/harvardx) where I include some of my projects.  

## APU Projects
The [APU Project repository](https://github.com/jiayong1008/apu) contains projects or assignments which I have completed during my Diploma study in Asia Pacific University (APU), Malaysia. Do check it out. 😄

## Personal Projects
This very repository is where I store all my personal projects that are neither Harvard nor APU's assignment. Each project are unique from each other and are developed when I have the need to automate something or find myself interested in a certain project. All my projects are listed as below, though, I plan to add more to this list as the time goes by:

1. **Sudoku**  
**Description:** Dump a sudoku question to this program, it will solve it for you, no matter how hard it is, provided the sudoku is indeed solvable. Try dumping any 'extreme' sudoku you find online to this program, if my program failed to solve, I owe you an ice cream 🍦.  
**Language:** Python  
:point_right: **[View More]()**  

2. **Stock**  
**Description:** A time planner application designed to help users efficiently and effectively schedule days or weeks ahead. Users will be able to register, login, customize weekly schedule (add, edit, delete), add special events, modify to-do list, and of course, logout.  
**Language:** Python

3. **Property**
